GameForum
Gampedia is forum based website for gaming news and topics of discussion.

Development server
Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/.

Description
It has a login/register functionality and after a user has been authenticated, they can create new threads, like existing ones or comment underneath in the comments section.

It fetches data from a JSON server, which also stores thread and profile images in base64 format (very inconvenient, yet useful enough for presentational purposes.)

The asdie part provides user with ability to look up threads by genre or game name or search a thread name with the help of quicksearch bar.

Users can check out their created threads and perform delete or edit operations on them.

They can also perform such operations on their own profiles, changing their credentials and profile photos.
